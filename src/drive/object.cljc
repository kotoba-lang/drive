  "Where the bytes are, and who may move them.

  `drive.workspace` models the tree, the permissions, the quota and the
  versions, and deliberately stops short of content: an item carries a
  `:drive/object-ref` and nothing here interprets it. That left a hole, and
  every consumer filling it privately fills it slightly differently — which
  for a permission boundary means each one gets a different answer to *may
  this principal read this file*.

  So the seam is here, next to the rules it has to obey.

  ## Bytes are a vector of unsigned ints

  Across `IObjectStore`, in both directions. The protocol did not say so at
  first, and within hours of it existing there were two implementations that
  disagreed: `drive.store.memory` and `drive.store.fs` pass vectors, and a
  Filecoin-backed store in `cloud-itonami-app` passes `byte[]`. Both are
  reasonable and neither is wrong — what was wrong was the protocol not
  saying.

  Unstated, the mismatch does not surface at the seam. It surfaces in whoever
  called `read-item`, as bytes that are a vector on one deployment and an
  array on another, and the code that works on both is code someone had to
  find out they needed.

  **What a byte is, though, is not drive's to decide.** `kotoba.bytes` exists
  for that, says the same thing in its own README, and was already a
  dependency of the protocol libraries around this one. Stating it a second
  time here — as this namespace did for a day, with a private `->bytes` — is
  how a workspace ends up with two definitions that can drift, which is the
  failure this section is about. So the definition is `kotoba.bytes/->bytes`
  and drive is one of its callers.

  It is applied at two places, which is not redundancy. `store-of` is a
  convenience; the contract is on `-get-object`, and a store written as a
  bare `reify` never passes through the convenience. Normalising only in
  `store-of` would mean the protocol held for stores built one particular
  way — which is not what a protocol is.

  ## What a store is not allowed to decide

  An `IObjectStore` is four operations over opaque references. It does not
  know about principals, roles, share links, trash or quota, and it must not:
  a store that could be asked directly for a reference is a store that can be
  asked for someone else's file. Everything in this namespace exists so that
  the store is only ever reached *after* the answer is yes.

  ## Four rules that are not obvious

  - **Trashed items are not readable.** `can-read?` says nothing about trash —
    `visible-items` filters it separately — so a caller composing `can-read?`
    with a store hands out deleted content. The check belongs with the fetch.
  - **Quota is checked before the bytes move, not after.** `add-version`
    throws when the total would exceed, which is correct and too late: the
    upload has already happened and the bandwidth is already spent.
  - **A new version must have a new object reference.** Reusing one silently
    replaces the bytes of an earlier version, and the history that says
    otherwise is still sitting in `:drive/versions`.
  - **A share link may read and never write.** `create-share-link` already
    refuses any role but `:viewer` and `:commenter`; this refuses the write
    rather than trusting that.

  ## Ordering, and what is left behind when something fails

  A write checks permission and quota first — both pure — then stores the
  bytes, then records the version. A store failure leaves the workspace
  untouched, which is the safe direction: the model never claims bytes that
  are not there. The other order can strand an object nothing references, and
  that is the direction this deliberately does not take."

  `add-version` adds and nothing subtracts. Trashing does not free anything
  and `forget-item` frees everything, so until now the only way to reclaim a
  heavily-edited document's history was to delete the document. A workspace
  where the cost of editing only ever goes up is one that eventually stops
  accepting writes for a reason its owner cannot act on.

  ## What it refuses

  `keep-count` below 1. The newest version is the document; a prune that
  could take it is a delete wearing another name, and `forget-item` is the
  one that says so out loud.

  Nothing else. Pruning when there is nothing to prune succeeds and frees
  zero, because a caller tidying up should not have to know in advance
  whether there was anything to tidy."
