  "An `IObjectStore` on a filesystem.

  JVM only, on purpose. `cloud-itonami-app` needs Java 21 anyway, so a Node
  branch here would be a second implementation nothing runs and no test
  covers — worse than its absence, because it would read as supported.

  ## References are not paths

  A reference arrives from a caller and is used as a filename, so it is
  refused unless it looks like one: no separators, no `..`, no leading dot,
  and nothing outside a small alphabet. A store that concatenated an arbitrary
  reference onto a directory would let whoever chose the reference name any
  file on the disk — including one outside the workspace, and including one it
  could then be asked to delete."
