  went there would come back out, having been restored by a fact about its
  parent. Recording which were cascaded is a second piece of state to keep in
  step with the first.

  Asking instead makes both operations exact. Trashing a folder hides
  everything under it because the answer changes for all of them at once;
  restoring reveals exactly what was visible before, because nothing else was
  ever touched. A file explicitly trashed inside a trashed folder stays
  trashed when the folder comes back — which is right, and is only possible
  because the two flags are independent."
