;; verify-cljs.cljs — two-runtime parity for the seam.
;;
;; Everything in `drive` except `drive.store.fs` is portable .cljc, and
;; `drive/object_test.cljc` has carried `:cljs` branches (js/Uint8Array in
;; place of byte[]) since the byte contract was written. Nothing ran them:
;; CI is `clojure -M:test`, which takes the `:clj` side of every one of those
;; reader conditionals. The ClojureScript half of the contract was asserted
;; and never executed — which is the same shape of claim the contract itself
;; was written to stop.
;;
;; This runs the seam under nbb against the host container that actually turns
;; up there. `drive.store.fs` is deliberately absent: it is JVM-only by
;; construction (java.nio) and says so.
